# CS Homework

The homework this week is far different from what we've done in the past. There is little to no coding involved, but rather writing and documenting concepts through essays. The length is up to you, but should be sufficient for a new reader to understand the topic.

You are encouraged to make each of these into a blog post on the platform of your choosing (we recommend using [Octopress])(http://octopress.org/) deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a code syntax highlighting system, but that's up to you!)

After someone who isn't familiar with one of these sets of topics reads these they should have at least a passable understanding of the concept described.

By 9am the next morning you must send a link to a Github repo or webpage with your essay in the Slack main room.

## Monday

Write an essay describing Queue, Stack, Linked Lists; what they are, how they are different, why we use them. It may be useful to include pseudocode, code, analogies, diagrams and references to external sources.

## Tuesday

Write an essay describing trees (overall), binary trees and tries; what they are, how they are different, why we use them. It may be useful to include pseudocode, code, analogies, diagrams and references to external sources.

## Wednesday

Write an essay describing the sorts that we have practiced (bubble, merge, insertion, quick, selection); what they are, how they are different, why we use them. It may be useful to include pseudocode, code, analogies, diagrams and references to external sources.

## Thursday

Write an essay describing the paradigms of *functional programming* and *object oriented programming*; what they are, how they are different, strengths/weakenesses, why we use them. It may be useful to include pseudocode, code, analogies, diagrams and references to external sources.

### Bonus

For any/all of the above, you are encouraged to find (and document/create) an interactive way to demonstrate the concept.
